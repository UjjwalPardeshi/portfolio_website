            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Ujjwal Surajkumar Pardeshi, a passionate machine learning (ML) enthusiast with a keen interest in exploring the potential of AI, deep learning, and computer vision. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in IoT at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, I’m dedicated to understanding how intelligent algorithms can analyze data, make predictions, and solve real-world problems.

I’ve worked on projects like MyVoice, which provides a voice for the mute using TensorFlow and OpenCV, and MetaShard, a decentralized finance (DeFi) solution combining blockchain technologies. As a Research Fellow at IEEE SRMIST, I have implemented GradCAM for analyzing MSTAR datasets and integrated pose estimation models using OpenPose and TensorFlow.

My mission is to continue building solutions that combine the power of AI and ML to optimize and innovate across various fields. I am actively seeking new challenges and opportunities in this exciting landscape.

                        Vision and Graphics lab, Dept. of CSE,
                                             Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.
                       
                       Dear Computer Vision Internship Applicant,
                       We are assigning you the task of training the DINO object detection model on a pedestrian dataset consisting of 200 images collected within the IIT Delhi campus. The dataset, annotated in COCO format, includes both images and corresponding annotations in JSON format (link provided below).
                       To help you better understand the data, please start by visualizing the bounding boxes on the images.
                       Dataset link: Dataset_for_CV_intern_Assignment
                       Task Instructions:
                       Dataset Preparation:
                       Split the dataset into two sets: a training set with 160 images and a validation set with 40 images.
                       Repository Setup:
                       Clone the DINO repository from this link and set up the necessary environment and dependencies as outlined in the repository instructions.
                       GPU Access:
                       If you do not have access to a GPU locally, use platforms such as Google Colab or Kaggle to carry out the task.
                       Pre-trained Model:
                       Download the pre-trained DINO-4scale model with the ResNet-50 (R50) backbone from the provided link in the repository.
                       Validation:
                       Run evaluations on the validation set using the pre-trained weights, as COCO contains a "person" class relevant to this task. You will need to adjust the config file to point to the correct dataset path. Follow the repository's instructions for running the evaluation script.
                       Report and Analysis:
                       Report the bounding box Average Precision (AP) values obtained from the validation set. Additionally, visualize the detection results and analyze any errors or cases where the model failed to detect objects correctly.
                       Fine-tuning:
                       Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the training set and re-evaluate the results on the validation set. You are free experiment any more methods which can help you improve your results. Also visualise the attention maps for the input images to better support your results.
                       Submission format: Submission will be through GitHub only. Upload your code to a GitHub repo with a well defined README.md explaining your experiments and the corresponding instructions to run your code. Your finetuned model weights should be uploaded to the Google Drive/OneDrive and its link should be added in the README.md of your submission GitHub repo. You will have to submit a short report in .pdf format in the same GitHub repo with the visualisations of the results as mentioned above and the loss graphs generated during fine-tuning. You can explain your experiments and the reasons for the failure cases in the report. 
                       Notes:
                       It is normal to encounter challenges during this task. We expect you to troubleshoot errors independently by searching for solutions online.
                       You will judged on the basis of your ability to setup and run the code and resolving the errors that come along the way. On understanding the core idea of the model and analysing its strengths and weaknesses to better enhance your results.
                       The task is expected to be completed within the deadline as mentioned in the email.
                       Explore the code and models in the GitHub repository.</p>
